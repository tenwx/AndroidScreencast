# Description

AndroidScreencast was developed to view and control your android device from a PC.

This project gives the opportunity to use your phone even with a broken screen.

## Features

- No client needed
- Support for Tap and Swipe gestures
- Write messages using PC keyboard
- Support for landscape mode
- Browse your phone files on PC
- Record video of your phone screen while browsing

## Configuration

There are 2 ways to run application:
1. Run ADB server on your own
2. Provide correct `app.properties` file

### Run ADB server on your own

In order to run server on your own you have to run already installed (or one from our OS-specific bundle) `adb`
with following command:
```
adb start-server
```

**Note**:

If `app.properties` will have `adb.path` filled - AndroidScreencast will shutdown ADB server on application termination.

Additionally, in order to use, for example, remote ADB server with ssh forwarding you should not use `app.properties` or `adb.path`
property should be commented.

### Provide correct `app.properties` file

Right now to successfully run application you **should** create `app.properties` file in the same folder as
AndroidScreencast's jar and provide at least one property - `adb.path` which should point to the `adb` executable file
within your OS, for example such location could be configured for Windows OS:
```properties
adb.path=adb/windows/adb.exe
```

Both absolute and relative paths are supported.

Example of valid `app.properties` could be find [here](app.properties).

Also we have got some valid OS-specific examples:
* [OSX app.properties](adb/macosx/app.properties)
* [Windows app.properties](adb/windows/app.properties)
* [Linux app.properties](adb/linux/app.properties)

They are actually the same, just `adb.path` is OS-specific. Files listed above are automatically included into OS-specific bundles.


### Additional properties
Here is the full list of available properties for application configuration.
Properties should be places in the `app.properties` file in the same folder as AndroidScreencast's jar file.

```properties
#relative or absolute path to ADB
adb.path=./adb
#maximum time to wait for device (in seconds)
adb.device.timeout=30
#maximum time to execute adb command (in seconds)
adb.command.timeout=5
#initial application window width (in pixels)
app.window.width=1024
#initial application window height (in pixels)
app.window.height=768
#Defines whether application should look 'natively' to OS. Possible values: true/false
app.native.look=false
```
## JNLP

Application is available using Java web start technology via [androidscreencast.jnlp][jnlp].

### Java security configuration

Due to Java security restriction policy, that was updated in java 7 and is restricted even more in java 8, we're now not
able to run JNLP without some security "hacks".

To use JNLP, please follow this article: [How can I configure the Exception Site List?][exception]

## Building and running from source

This project requires at least Java 8.

After cloning the project, run `mvnw install`.

The resulting artifacts will be created in the `target` subdirectory.

You can run the executable jar via `java -jar target/androidscreencast-VERSION-executable.jar`, replacing VERSION with
the current version.

For example, `java -jar target/androidscreencast-0.0.10s-executable.jar`.

Additionally OS-packages would be created with ADB executables bundled:
* `androidscreencast-VERSION-windows.zip`
* `androidscreencast-VERSION-linux.tar.gz`
* `androidscreencast-VERSION-macosx.tar.gz`

In order to provide correct configuration see [configuration][configuration_section] section.

# Requirements

Currently AndroidScreencast works directly with `adb input` program through `ddmlib` and abuse functionality of:
* `adb input key`
* `adb input tap`
* `adb input swipe`

Regarding this point, to use AndroidScreencast you need Smartphone running on Android with specific `input` program version. `adb input tap` and `adb input swipe` were introduced in [Android 4.1.1][Android_4_1_1_Input].

So, right now AndroidScreencast support all Android versions equal or greater than Android 4.1.1.

Also, to run AndroidScreencast you will need *adb* installed (or you can use bundled in OS bundles adb).
