### Java security configuration

Due to Java security restriction policy, that was updated in java 7 and is restricted even more in java 8, we're now not
able to run JNLP without some security "hacks".

To use JNLP, please follow this article: [How can I configure the Exception Site List?][exception]

# Requirements

Currently AndroidScreencast works directly with `adb input` program through `ddmlib` and abuse functionality of:
- `adb input key`
- `adb input tap`
- `adb input swipe`

Regarding this point, to use AndroidScreencast you need Smartphone running on Android with specific `input` program version. `adb input tap` and `adb input swipe` were introduced in [Android 4.1.1][Android_4_1_1_Input].

So, right now AndroidScreencast support all Android versions equal or greater than Android 4.1.1.

Also, to run AndroidScreencast you will need *adb* installed (or you can use bundled in OS bundles adb).
